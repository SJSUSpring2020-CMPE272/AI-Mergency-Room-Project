**Project Title**

  *AI-mergency Control Room (AICR)*
       
   * What does AICR do?

		As it is well known that the number of emergency calls increased eightfold 
		over a course of four days when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and
		flooded New Orleans, it is very overwhelming to keep first-responder teams o
		rganized and efficient in emergency situations. AI-mergency Control Room ensures
		that dispatchers stay productive and creates better workflow for first-responders 
		that are involved in these situations.  AICR includes anything from proper
		incident prioritization to visibility and traceability of major events.


   * Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for?)

		The AICR is primarily to help people in dangerous situations such as natural disasters
		and other emergency situations by supporting dispatchers to stay fully productive during
		such circumstances. As a group we would like to contribute to the project by providing a 
		UI and also add more functionality to existing features. We may integrate the AI Fairness 
		360 toolkit into this project to help us make our project as unbiased as possible.

   * How does AICR work?

        AICR automatically transcribes incoming calls and extract all the detailed information by
		the help of Watson Natural Language Understanding and Watson Knowledge Studio. The status
		of the situation and all the incidents are then visualized inorder to give the operator 
		full overview of the current situation which inturn helps the dispatcher to track emergency
		spots and prioritization. AICR is using a database powered by Db2 to store all the call 
		information and allows to trace calls during and after the emergency.

**Project Title**

  *Movie success prediction using data-mining PHP*

   * Project idea description
	
		Uses historical data of each component such as actor, actress, director, release date,  music 
		to indicate if a movie will be a flop or hit.  With the help of AI we can easily pattern match 
		successful or unsuccessful characteristics of past movies and turn them into future projections.
		By assigning each movie characteristic a weight we are able to create surface-level movie analysis 
		and also be able to filter out characteristics which are not important.


   * Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)

		With the emergence of movie review websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, consumers have been relying 
		heavily on these reviews to be a deciding factor in whether or not they go see a movie.  However, 
		these reviews are usually only present shortly prior to movie release.  The goal of this project 
		is to potentially give the movie industry a pre-analysis of their movie to help optimize profits, 
		but also to give consumers a chance to view movie reviews from another perspective.  Although the 
		criteria in which it is being graded is surface-level, it is a useful tool for consumers to aid plan
		their movie trips accordingly.


   * Technology stack

		* Front-end: ReactJS
		* https://imdbpy.github.io/ - To retrieve data from IMDB (movie database)
		* Twitter API calls to search through tweet trends
		* Facebook API calls to search public posts for mention of movie
		* Database: Firebase
