#Project Title
AI-mergency Control Room (AICR)
       
   What does AICR do?

		As it is well known that the number of emergency calls increased eightfold over a course
		of four days when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and flooded New Orleans, it is very
		overwhelming to keep first-responder teams organized and efficient in emergency situations.
		AI-mergency Control Room ensures that dispatchers stay productive and creates better workflow 
		for first-responders that are involved in these situations.  AICR includes anything from proper
		incident prioritization to visibility and traceability of major events.


   Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for?)

		The AICR is primarily to help people in dangerous situations such as natural disasters and other
		emergency situations by supporting dispatchers to stay fully productive during such circumstances. 
		As a group we would like to contribute to the project by providing a UI and also add more functionality
		to existing features. We may integrate the AI Fairness 360 toolkit into this project to help us make our 
		project as unbiased as possible.

	How does AICR work?

        AICR automatically transcribes incoming calls and extract all the detailed information by the help of Watson
		Natural Language Understanding and Watson Knowledge Studio. The status of the situation and all the incidents 
		are then visualized inorder to give the operator full overview of the current situation which inturn helps the
		dispatcher to track emergency spots and prioritization. AICR is using a database powered by Db2 to store all the
		call information and allows to trace calls during and after the emergency.
