 Project Title
AI-mergency Control Room (AICR)
       
   What does AICR do?
As it is well known that the number of emergency calls increased eightfold over a course of four days when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and flooded New Orleans, it is very overwhelming to keep first-responder teams organized and efficient in emergency situations. AI-mergency Control Room ensures that dispatchers stay productive and creates better workflow for first-responders that are involved in these situations.  AICR includes anything from proper incident prioritization to visibility and traceability of major events.
    Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for?)
The AICR is primarily to help people in dangerous situations such as natural disasters and other emergency situations by supporting dispatchers to stay fully productive during such circumstances. As a group we would like to contribute to the project by providing a UI and also add more functionality to existing features. We may integrate the AI Fairness 360 toolkit into this project to help us make our project as unbiased as possible.
